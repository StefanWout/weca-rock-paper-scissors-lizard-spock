#  Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game

For the Code Institute Bootcamp Hackathon #2, our team decided to complete the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. We used the challenge provided by Frontend Mentor to come up with the general layout and style of the app while customizing elements of it to better suit our own sensibilities.

## Features 

### User stories

- __Sitewide__

  - As a user, I want the game to be mobile-responsive, so that I can play on my smartphone or tablet device.
  - As a site owner, I want a game to entertain users.
  - As a user, I want to be able to see a score to know how well I am doing.
  - As a user, I want to be able to read the rules of the game to understand how it works.

### Gamepage

   - This site is a simple online game for rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. Based on the game popularised in The Big Bang Theory.
   - When first loaded users are presented with a rules modal, a diagram showing each outcome of the game. This can be closed by either clicking the "X" or the "Rules" button, which is set to toggle the modal.
   - Users can then play the game by selecting any of the 5 options, presented as buttons each with a symbol representing the choice made.
   - Once a selection has been made the outcome is displayed towards the bottom of the screen.
   - Users can then play again by selecting one of the 5 options and the outcome will update to reflect the new result.
   - The score counter will increase by 1 with every victory for the user, and decrease by 1 with every defeat.
   - Users can rest the score counter, and therefore the game, by clicking the "Reset Game" button.

## Wireframes

  - The below wireframe images show our original ideas for the basic layout of the page.

## Features We'd implement in the future if we could

  - A final count on the score at, for instance 5/-5, where the user or compueter would win and the game would reset at that point.
